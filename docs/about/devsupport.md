# Developing support

The full code of the application is not currently published in the public domain, but some libraries used in the application are published. Therefore, you have a chance to contribute to this project.

In the tab In development, you can find information about what is planned to be done in the near future. For example, in the new version of the application, since version 5, the tool for calculating the winding layout for an electric motor is not available. Initially, this tool was built into the application and, according to the statement, did not require an Internet connection to use it. But since this approach may violate copyright, this tool was excluded from version 5. So you can influence the course of events!
