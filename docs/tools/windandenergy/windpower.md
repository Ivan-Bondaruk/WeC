Wind Power ‚Äî Theoretical Wind Power

## üìö Theory

**Theoretical wind power** is the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the air flow passing through the area swept by the wind turbine blades. This calculation is based on the assumption of perfect efficiency (ignoring losses), i.e. it is the upper limit of the available energy.

Understanding this value is important for:

> assessing the potential of an installation at a specific location,

> preliminary comparison of different turbines and their diameters,

> optimizing the location of wind turbines.

??? note "Tip" 
    In practice, some energy is lost due to mechanical, aerodynamic and         electrical factors, but the theoretical power serves as a starting point for calculations.

### Formula
$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot v^3
$$
Where:

P is the theoretical wind power (W),

œÅ is the air density (kg/m¬≥), typically about 1.225 kg/m¬≥ at sea level and 15¬∞C,

A is the area swept by the blades, $A = \pi \cdot \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2$, where D is the rotor diameter,

v is the wind speed (m/s).

This formula demonstrates a cubic dependence on wind speed: a small increase in speed significantly increases the power.
