## üìò Theory

While the **theoretical wind power** represents the maximum kinetic energy available in the wind, in real-world conditions a wind turbine can only convert **a portion** of that energy into usable electricity. This is due to various **losses and limitations**, including:

- The **Betz Limit** (physical limit of aerodynamic efficiency),
- **Mechanical and electrical losses** (friction, gearbox, generator inefficiencies),
- **Environmental factors** (turbulence, blade soiling, temperature effects),
- **Suboptimal wind conditions** (variable wind speeds, wind shear).

To estimate the **actual usable electrical power**, we apply an **overall efficiency factor** to the theoretical wind power.

## üìê Formula

The estimated actual power output is calculated using:

$$
P_{\text{actual}} = \eta \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot v^3 \right)
$$
